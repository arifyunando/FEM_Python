# Finite Element Method with Python
> Exploration of Finite Element Method implementation using Python

Finite Element Method is a numerical method used to calculate partial differential equations problems. 
This program contains the implementations of FEM in simple scale. 
I built it personally to learn the algorithm and write my undergraduate thesis upon it. 
It is built with accordance to FEM course held by Bilkent University and developed to fit Geotechnical Engineering needs.
